# ToDoList

A simple to-do list project to familiarise myself with the basics of Angular and JavaScript. A live version of this app can be found at: https://aadam-gafar.github.io/ToDoList/. It is sourced from a separate branch.

To build your own version, clone the repository and ensure the following settings are enabled in your branch:
- In angular.json, set "outputPath" to "docs"
- In package.json, set "private" to "false"
- In index.json, set <base href="/ToDoList">

Then run `ng build` in the terminal.
